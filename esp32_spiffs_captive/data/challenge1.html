<p>Howdy, and welcome to this TAMU Challenge. Work the problem, and present the solution to the Aggie running the challenge for a small prize.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>One day, Ham Radio Reveille was listening to her radio and heard a strange noise.</p>
<p>It&#39;s up to you to work the challenge and figure out what she was listening to.</p>

<p>Once you have the solution, look for someone wearing a maroon shirt or a maroon facemask that says &quot;BTHO COVID-19&quot; and show them what you came up with.</p>
<hr>
<p>This challenge is running off of an ESP32. If you find a way to break it, please let me know   😀</p>
